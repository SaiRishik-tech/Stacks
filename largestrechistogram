a greedy, center-expanding approach s
my bruteforce
ount =0;
a loop intially to check which is greatest in the given array 
store it in tempheight 
maxi=INT_MAX
set count +=1
now calculate area =height*count;
maxarea=max(area,maxi);

but now i need to check which is greater next i-1 or i+1
choose that and then set height tot which is smaller 
increment count 
calculate area again 
like thsi do for all
return maxarea;


corrected code based on above idea 
int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
    int n = heights.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    int maxHeight = 0, maxIndex = 0;
    
    // Step 1: Find the tallest bar
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (heights[i] > maxHeight) {
            maxHeight = heights[i];
            maxIndex = i;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Start expanding from tallest bar
    int left = maxIndex;
    int right = maxIndex;
    int minHeight = heights[maxIndex];
    int maxArea = minHeight * 1;  // Only the bar itself
    int width = 1;

    // Step 3: Expand until full array is covered
    while (left > 0 || right < n - 1) {
        // Choose the side with taller bar next
        if (left == 0) right++;
        else if (right == n - 1) left--;
        else if (heights[left - 1] > heights[right + 1]) left--;
        else right++;

        // Update min height in this range
        minHeight = min(minHeight, min(heights[left], heights[right]));
        width++;
        maxArea = max(maxArea, minHeight * width);
    }

    return maxArea;
}

Got it ‚Äî you're asking how to reach the optimized O(n) stack solution by thinking through it step-by-step using the right problem-solving questions.

Let me guide you with that mindset ‚Äî the way an experienced coder or interviewer would debug and refine the idea.

üß† Correct Thinking Approach via Smart Questions:
‚úÖ 1. What's the core operation?
‚ùì What do I need to find?

You need the largest area of any rectangle that can be formed with contiguous bars.

‚úÖ 2. What defines a rectangle in the histogram?
‚ùì How is the area of a rectangle in the histogram calculated?

Area = height √ó width

The height is the smallest height in the range.

The width is the number of bars used.

‚úÖ 3. Why is brute force inefficient?
‚ùì What happens if I try every start and end index and find the min height in that range?

You get O(n¬≤) time since min height takes O(n) per range in worst-case.

‚úÖ 4. Can we fix a height instead?
‚ùì What if I fix one bar as the height and expand left/right to find how far it can stretch?

Yes ‚Äî for each bar i, we try to find:

left boundary: how far left it can go without hitting a smaller bar.

right boundary: how far right it can go without hitting a smaller bar.

So:

cpp
Copy
Edit
area[i] = height[i] * (right[i] - left[i] - 1)
‚úÖ 5. Can I compute left and right bounds efficiently?
‚ùì Can we preprocess the next smaller to left and next smaller to right for every bar?

Yes! And here's where we use a monotonic stack.

‚úÖ 6. How does a monotonic stack help?
‚ùì What does a stack help track in this case?

It helps us:

Maintain increasing bar heights.

When a shorter bar comes, we know the current bar is the right boundary for those in the stack.

This lets us compute the width for that popped bar.

‚úÖ 7. How do I use the stack to calculate area directly?
‚ùì When do I pop from the stack and compute the area?

When the current height is less than the top of the stack:

Pop the top ‚Üí that bar is bounded now.

Compute width:

If stack is empty ‚Üí width = i (start to current)

Else ‚Üí width = i - st.top() - 1

Area = popped height √ó width

‚úÖ 8. How to ensure all bars are processed?
‚ùì What happens to the bars remaining in the stack?

Add a dummy zero at the end (heights.push_back(0)) so all bars get flushed out.

‚úÖ Final Insight:
"Use a stack to track increasing bar indices. When a smaller bar appears, it means the previous bars cannot extend beyond this, so pop them and calculate areas. This gives an O(n) solution."




optimized solution
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
    int n = heights.size();
    stack<int> st;
    int maxArea = 0;
    heights.push_back(0);

    for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
        while (!st.empty() && heights[i] < heights[st.top()]) {
            int height = heights[st.top()];
            st.pop();
            int width = st.empty() ? i : (i - st.top() - 1);
            maxArea = max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
        st.push(i);
    }

    return maxArea;
    }
};
